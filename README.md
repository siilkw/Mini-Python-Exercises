# mini-python-exercises
A set of solutions for some basic programming challenges! 
I am new to Python and I am uploading my solutions as I solve them, both to practice putting them out there and to become more familiar with GitHub.

These exercises are from CodeAcademy's Python Tutorial, from karan's list of projects on Github, and from http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/
